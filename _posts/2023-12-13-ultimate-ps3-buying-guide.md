# The Ultimate PS3 Buying Guide

You never really know how many models of PS3 there are until you actually look it up and check for yourself, which quickly becomes overwhelming considering that each have their own respective features and functionalities. While some support hardware level PS2 emulation and feature 4 USB ports, others run cooler, have more reliable motherboards, are way smaller, but only support PS3 and PS1 games. Some support completely custom firmware from 3rd party developers while others only support hybrid firmware and their respective original firmware. Picking the right model for you is just like picking a phone: each model plays to specific needs and depends on the needs of the end user. Quickly make a list of things you want about a PS3 and come back to help you analyze the best model for your needs so you can get back to feeling the early 2000's nostalgia.

## ![](RackMultipart20231213-1-bnjwmy_html_cae7fcecb55b9255.png) CECH-AXX, CECH-CXX, CECH-E

- Hardware level support for PS2 games
- Four front facing USB ports
- Supports PS2 games in ISO or CUE/BIN format
- Original design for the PS3
- Weakest versions (run hot, YLOD, inefficient and uses the most power)
- CFW and HFW support
- Recommend the A model if you want full compatibility with the PS2 library, or the E model if you want 90% of the library but better graphics.

## CECH-BXX

- Worst backward compatible model
- No PS2 memory card slot, no WiFi, 20 GB of onboard storage
- Weakest version (run hot, YLOD, inefficient and uses the most power)

## CECH-GXX and CECH-HXX

- More efficient CELL (65nm), but OG RSX (90nm)
- Still runs pretty hot, susceptible to YLOD
- 2x front facing USB ports
- Not hardware compatible with PS2

## CECH-JXX, CECH-KXX, CECH-LXX, CECH-MXX, CECH-PXX, CECH-QXX

- More efficient CELL and RSX (both at 65nm)
- Software PS2 emulation support with ISO and CUE/BIN
- CFW and HFW support
- 2 front facing USB ports
- Recommend: CECH-JXX or CECH-KXX because that particular board is the least susceptible to YLOD of the phat models. CECH-JXX may be found for cheaper because of the smaller HDD, which you can upgrade at any time.

## CECH-20XXA and CECH-20XXB

- 20XXA has a 120 GB HDD while the 20XXB has a 250 GB HDD
- 2 front facing USB ports
- CFW and HFW support
- 45nm CELL, 65nm RSX
- Do no recommend since the 21XXA/B have 40nm RSX's that will be better at the same price point.

CECH-21XXA, CECH-21XXB

- 45nm CELL, 40nm RSX
- 21XXA has 120 GB of storage and the 21XXB has 250 GB of storage
- CFW and HFW support
- Least hassle with CFW without messing with other tools or date codes

## CECH-25XXA/B (manufactured before 2011)

- Best model because it is the newest model that supports CFW with minimal hassle
- 2 front facing USB ports
- 45nm CELL, 40nm RSX
- If the console has 120 GB or 250 GB it fully supports CFW
- Any other capacity, check the date or use minverchk

## CECH-25XXA/B (manufactured 2011 or later)

- I do not recommend these models since the prior iterations are practically the same and fully support CFW without hassle. However, if you already own this console, it **can** still be hacked depending on the date and minverchk result
- If minverchk shows 3.50, you're in good hands and can go ahead with CFW
- If minverchk shows 3.55 or 3.56, then you will need a hardware flasher to use CFW
- If minverchk shows 3.60, then the console only supports HFW

| minverchk version | Result |
| --- | --- |
| 3.50 | CFW or HFW |
| 3.55 or 3.56 | Hardware flasher CFW or HFW |
| 3.60 | HFW only |

## CECH-3000 series

- Only supports HFW
- Supports PS2 emulation via CUE/BIN
- Last generation before the super-slim
- Only buy this version if you really hate the super-slim design and want to use HFW or OFW

## ![](RackMultipart20231213-1-bnjwmy_html_ef49d646eb3b09c0.png) CECH-4000 series

- Most efficient series
- Only supports HFW
- Least liked design, but it is the smallest, quietest, and most reliable
- Buy a CECH-43XXB/C model if you want the best of the super-slim (40nm CELL, 28nm RSX)

## FAQ

CFW vs HFW

CFW, or Custom Firmware, is the more reliable and least buggy hack made available for the PS3. It allows you more complete control of the console and its files at an instant rather than temporarily, like HFW. However, using CFW makes you more likely to be banned by Sony.

HFW, or Hybrid Firmware, is basically a temporary hack that needs to be reactivated after each reboot. It tends to have more issues but also makes you less susceptible to permanent bans from Sony.

The only things I would do to a PS3 for upkeep would be to upgrade the HDD to a larger 1 TB or smaller HDD (do not waste your money on an SSD) and ensuring there's no dust in the vents or around the inside of the console. Most other methods of upkeep, such as deliding or fan replacement, can cause bricked consoles if not done properly and do not usually yield much of an improvement to the original untampered system.

Which model should I buy if I want to play my PS2 game discs?

CECH-AXX or CECH-CXX. While the CECH-EXX model would work too, it utilizes a hybrid hardware emulation limiting you to about 90% of the PS2 game library. The first and third model both support hardware level PS2 emulation (emotion engine chip and graphics synthesizer) while the CECH-EXX model does not include the emotion engine chip and relies on the CELL and graphics synthesizer. Both of these models also have the added bonus of 4 front facing USB ports, 60 GB of onboard storage, PS2 memory cards, and WiFi (looking at the CECH-BXX model there).

Which model should I buy if I want custom firmware and reliability pretty easily?

CECH-21XXB would be the best model, being fully compatible with custom firmware, featuring a 320 GB HDD, and being the newest model that supports custom firmware without looking at date codes or checking the minimum version. The smaller 45nm CELL and 40nm RSX means lower temperatures which in turn means a more reliable system.

Which model if I just want to play my PS3 discs laying around and will never touch CFW?

Definitely the CECH-4301C model. Not only are you getting the newest model with the smallest RSX and CELL, but you are getting the smallest and quietest console too.

In what cases would you buy a 25XX series PS3?

I honestly wouldn't bother unless you already own one of these models. It can be a hassle to get these on CFW because you have to check the date code and the minimum supported firmware and hope that it works. In some cases, a hardware flasher may be required which would increase the cost if you don't already have one. You'd just be better off with a different model altogether really.

Is there a super slim model you would avoid?

Steer clear of any CECH-4000 series that has an A on the end of the model number. These consoles use eMMC storage devices instead of the traditional HDD storage which restricts you to however big that storage device is. All the A models in the 4000 series are just 12 GB and are **non-upgradeable**. You can still attach external storage, but that means having something plugged up at all times when you could just upgrade the internal hard drive for cheap and remove the hassle.

What PS2 games are compatible with select PS3 consoles?

The complete list is available [here](https://en.everybodywiki.com/List_of_PlayStation_2_games_compatible_with_PlayStation_3) for compatibility with the first two generations of console (CECH-A/B/C/E). Check [this](https://ps3.aldostools.org/ps2config.html) link for compatibility with CFW and or HFW.

How do I use minverck?

Use this [download](https://www.psx-place.com/resources/minverchk-minimum-version-checker.610/download?version=967) link and extract the contents of the downloaded file. Then, grab any USB and plug it in to your PC or laptop. Make sure it is empty and then format it to FAT32 using any disk management software. Then, open a file manager, go to the USB and create a folder. Name that folder "PS3" and then open that folder and create another folder called UPDATE. Copy the .PUP file you extracted from the download and then plug it in to the PS3. Boot the PS3 up and navigate to the system update menu under settings. Use the local storage method to update and then the checker tool will display the minimum firmware available for the console.

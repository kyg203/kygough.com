It's that time of month again! New month brings new music, especially when we are this close to Valentine's Day. Weather you'll be celebrating with someone special, or celebrating for yourself (or with your best friends), these songs are all for you. Most of them are still alternative, but I do delve into the pop realm a bit to rediscover some of my own favourites, along with a new-ish genre from the likes of HUNTAR. As you all know, I love categorizing music, and the dark electronic vibes from HUNTAR produce a very chilled vibe that any one can relax to. Dive in to the first track to get your groove on!

Love Song - WEIRD! - YUNGBLUD

It was extremely difficult to choose between Love Song and Cotton Candy, so in the end I... You'll see. I had to include this song as a reminder for anyone that does not have a partner to love yourself and just keep being you. Don't change yourself for someone else, change yourself for you and only you. This has taught me quite a bit recently. 



Emo Girl - MAINSTREAM SELLOUT - Machine Gun Kelly ft. WILLOW

This song was literally just released today and I'm already obsessed. I still cannot believe Kells changed the name of the album last minute, from Born With Horns to MAINSTREAM SELLOUT. While I do understand his reasoning behind the change, I really hope we get a Born With Horns titled album. I really was becoming attached to the idea of that album as soon as I watched the music video for Papercuts. Let's just hope the concept of the upcoming album stays the same (or better yet, changes so we can have the meaningful hard rock 'Born With Horns' album we all desire from Kells). Anyway, this song is another banger from the pop-punker and I cannot wait to hear more! Leaks for the next album say it'll be released March 25th. 



Angels & Demons, Pt. 2 - Tell Me About Tomorrow - Jxdn

This right here: perfect breakup song. It comes in pretty slow, but the words are relatable and emotional enough to instantly connect. Fast forward to the end and it becomes something you can just release anger to without the song becoming full-out angry. Kind of a way to let go and feel better about yourself. Makes me feel better every time. This is actually the first song I ever learned all the words to. 



Wise Up - Your Favourite Worst Mistake - HUNTAR

Described as the dark price of RnB (or, as he describes his musical style, future RnB), HUNTAR has already collaborated with the likes of Gucci Mane and iLoveMakonnen and is continuing to climb the ladders. This is one track from his debut mixtape, Your Favourite Worst Mistake, where he explores the electronic RnB genre quite a bit. His song from the same mixtape, Anyway, actually featured in the FIFA 17 soundtrack too!



Twenty One - Greyson Chance

Twenty One pretty much describes being 21 as being in the golden age of your youth, being exposed to a number of new things and traditionally already in college, therefore also being away from parental supervision. Even though it is really relaxed, it brings a sense of being free and, carefree and wistfully happy. 



Next To Me - Evolve - Imagine Dragons

An ode to frontman, Dan Reynolds, wife, Aja Volkman, Next To Me describes their relationship and love for one another, how Volkman always comes back and forgives Reynolds for his mistakes. You can tell just from the lyrics and the musical style that he truly is thankful for her, even to re-release the Evolve album with this track as the first song to appear on the album. 



Kiss Me Kiss Me - 5SOS

5 Seconds Of Summer will forever and always be my go to for nostalgia these days, providing enough emo and pop-punk to suffice while also being pop enough and mainstream enough to listen to with friends and family. 



Say You Won't Let Go - Back From The Edge - James Arthur

The lead single to Arthur's comeback album, Back From The Edge, Let Go was an instant hit almost everywhere! So much so, that most people for some reason cannot stand it anymore, due to it being overplayed on the radio. Well, for those that still haven't heard it, please listen to it! Anyone who already has listened and don't like it, try it again!



Lost - Handwritten (Target Exclusive) - Shawn Mendes

I can imagine going on a crazy date with someone to this song, right out of a movie scene. I love how it genuinely makes me lost in a moment and actually has me re-imagining all of my favourite memories over and over again. It's not that popular a song from Mendes either, especially because it's a Target Exclusive track and cannot (legally) be heard anywhere else. 



Happy - Inner Monologue, Pt. 1 - Julia Michaels

An essential hit to release anger, I really wish Michaels' got more attention from some of her content as it really is perfect for most feelings. Most of her stuff is acoustic and really doesn't stray far from pop.



Have a great month! See you all for next months edition.

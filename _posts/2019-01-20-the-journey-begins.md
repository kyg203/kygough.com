Hey there! I am Ky; I'm a beginner freelance writer, blogger and photographer and I love talking about technology, music, and photographs. If you have already seen my about page, I'm sure you know that I do more than that but this is just about my blogging and journalism. I thought of some questions you may ask about my blog and what I'll primarily be writing about, so I combined them into a small Q&A to hopefully give you a better idea of topics. I am not just limited to these topics, you can suggest any you like, but this will be what the blog will primarily about. Take a look below!

1. What are you going to write about?

    I'm going to write about a few broad topics, however I will primarily be focusing on technology since that is what I know best. It's part of my job to know the latest tech, so writing about it really helps me learn the information, plus some tips and tricks, that I can teach customers to help them. I may write about music or other stuff to as and when I feel like it, however you will see a lot of technology based articles and blog posts.

2. Democratic or Republican?

    Both. Neither. In between. I have ideas that represent both parties, and therefore I cannot classify myself as either, nor neither. I don't exactly like the divide between the whole country because of the difference in parties either. Only 3% of the United States are directly between the two, so I'm definitely proud to say that.

3. Are you going to write guides and "how-to's"?

    Yes, I am going to write guides, but they will mostly be about technology and some random things which I just know how to do. Don't expect much DIY, as I'm the least creative person ever, even though I love being creative.

4. Are you religious and will you include your religious beliefs within your posts?

    In Sweden and many countries in Europe, you don't talk about your religion. Not face to face, not online, not anywhere. Only at home with people who are of the same religion, or at the special place of the religion, like a mosque or a church. I'm going to put out there that I am not religious, but I will not include anything about religion within my posts.

5. Do you post on any social media sites?

    My main social media of choice is Twitter, however I do post on my public Instagram from time to time. Usually smaller content, like product launches and quick reviews. My social media links will be at the bottom of every page. :)

6. Which brand(s) do you affiliate with most?

    I don't necessarily have a thing for any one specific brand, but I currently use a Samsung phone and watch, Nothing headphones, and a Dell laptop. I have only ever owned one Apple product, but would be open to potentially trying some of the newer products. I tend to stick to the mid-range section of the market across most product categories.

7. What content can we expect when you write about music?

    My music content usually consists of top 10's, but I may begin writing more about music besides just ranking them and artists. Feel free to comment any topics you want me to cover in music. 

8. Will you write anything health related?

    No, I have not, at least, not YET. I may write a couple on different mental illnesses and to spread awareness of other diseases, and I may also try to help other people who need expensive medical care advertise to raise money for their cause. As someone who suffers from anxiety, OCD and hypersensitivity, which have all stemmed from my Autism, I can give tips and tricks to help other people who are facing problems with these mental illnesses. I may also write about cooking and provide cheap meal plans that I've learned from being a college student.

9. What is the projects page for?

    Basically, I have a lot of ideas which I can never keep track of. So, how do I remember them? I put them here, where everyone can see them. That way, other people can help me through certain challenges and become part of some of my efforts. At the time of writing, I'm working on a few icon packs and putting together some wallpaper collections, but I have began working on an Android custom ROM for my OnePlus 8 and making my own Linux dsitro. Check out the page for status updates on these projects and more.

10. Ally?

    I am part of the LGBTQ+ community, and I strive for equality within all of our minorities, not just the LGBTQ+. I don't care if you like me or hate me, or even if you are completely different to me. We are all human, and as long as we treat each other equally, I couldn't care less what you looked like or who you loved.

I hope these have answered some of your questions, but, if they have not, feel free to contact me. My email and a contact form is available on the contact tab, and I will respond to any email as quickly as possible.

Enjoy your day, and don't forget to smile!

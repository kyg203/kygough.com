In an exclusive interview with INVERSE, Carl Pei, founder of Nothing and co-founder of OnePlus, talks a bit about the Nothing Phone (2) and furthering their reach to the U.S. market. Although he keeps pretty tight lipped about the specifications and the design of the ucpoming device, he does tell them that the Phone (2) will be "more premium" compared to the Phone (1). He refuses to refer to it as a flagship device because that would entail high end specs that would be in direct competition with the Ultra's and Pro's of the market, which is not the primary aim for Nothing. "Mobile chipsets have really improved over the last seven to nine years. That’s why I want to avoid calling the Phone 2 a flagship because that would mean that the Phone 1 was not a flagship. Within our own portfolio of smartphones, the Phone 1 was very much a flagship in terms of the amount of care we put into the product. That’s why I used the word ‘premium’ [to describe the Phone 2] instead, which signifies that it’s a more premium step up, but it’s still a flagship just like the Phone 1."

Carl Pei officially tells Inverse in an interview that the Nothing Phone (2) is real, it will be available in the U.S., and it will be coming "later this year" (2023)

It will be a "more premium" handset compared to the Phone (1). 

Didn't launch in U.S. because they were building their team as they were building the products, have grown to 400 employees and are ready for their next big launch.

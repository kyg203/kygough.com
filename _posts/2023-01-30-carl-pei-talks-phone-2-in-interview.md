`In an exclusive interview with ![INVERSE](https://www.inverse.com/gear/nothing-phone-2-us-2023-release-carl-pei-interview) , Carl Pei talks a bit about the Phone (2) and furthering their reach into the U.S. market.`

The Nothing Phone (1) saw massive success in Europe and Asia with the Nothing startup selling more than half a million units within a year, surpassing the likes of the Essential Phone PH-1 a few years earlier. While the Phone (1) is still a bit behind Nothing's earbud offerings, the Ear (1)'s and Ear (Sticks), it's only by a small margin. It's clear that Nothing has built a brand up from almost nothing and they're only planning on broadening their reach in the world with the Phone (2). 

Although he keeps pretty tight lipped about the specifications and the design of the upcoming device, he does tell Inverse that the Phone (2) will be "more premium" compared to the Phone (1). However, He refuses to refer to it as a flagship device because that would entail high end specs that would be in direct competition with the Ultra's and Pro's of the market, which is not the primary goal for Nothing. "Mobile chipsets have really improved over the last seven to nine years. Thatâ€™s why I want to avoid calling the Phone 2 a flagship because that would mean that the Phone 1 was not a flagship. Within our own portfolio of smartphones, the Phone 1 was very much a flagship in terms of the amount of care we put into the product."

Originally, Pei had decided not to launch the Phone (2) anytime soon because he didn't want to launch a new device every year and so the Nothing team could focus on the Phone (1)'s software. However, the company has grown since then, doubling their team from 200 to 400 which has helped them make Nothing OS completely in-house rather than half-in and half-out. The Nothing team had just successfully launched Nothing OS 1.5 based on Android 13 this month, Jan. 13th, four days earlier than the expected Jan. 17th launch-date. 

One third of all ear(1) sales were bought in the U.S., which means that Nothing missed out on one-third of their sales volume for the Nothing Phone (1), which was not made available in the U.S. for awhile. Nothing has sinced launched a beta program bringing the Phone (1) state-side for a cheaper $299 (which is for the 8 GB RAM 128 GB black model) for people willing enough to face connectivity issues for the cool hardware. They noted that while you will have spotty service on Verizon and AT&T, you will be able to access 5G via T-Mobile's N41 5G band. A few users on Reddit and Twitter have said they managed 5G on AT&T and Verizon too, but this may not be the case for all users in various parts of the U.S.

Besides talking about ambitions and goals for the device, we weren't told anything about the handsets specifications or design. We assume it will carry the same glyph interface as the Phone (1), maybe in a different configuration but definitely not with any coloured LEDs, per Pei's tweet calling the idea "cringe." The Nothing team also reviewed some concept designs from fans across the world which the team were more receptive of some ideas more than others. We'll just have to wait and see what Nothing conjure up for us this year, although I bet it won't be Nothing.

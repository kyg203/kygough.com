The Nothing Phone (1) saw massive success in Europe and Asia with the Nothing startup selling more than half a million units within a year, surpassing the likes of the Essential Phone PH-1 a few years earlier. While the Phone (1) is still a bit behind Nothing's earbud offerings, the Ear (1)'s and Ear (Sticks), it's only by a small margin. It's clear that Nothing has built a brand up from almost nothing and they're only planning on broadening their reach in the world with the Phone (2). 

Although he keeps pretty tight lipped about the specifications and the design of the upcoming device, he does tell Inverse that the Phone (2) will be "more premium" compared to the Phone (1). However, He refuses to refer to it as a flagship device because that would entail high end specs that would be in direct competition with the Ultra's and Pro's of the market, which is not the primary goal for Nothing. "Mobile chipsets have really improved over the last seven to nine years. That’s why I want to avoid calling the Phone 2 a flagship because that would mean that the Phone 1 was not a flagship. Within our own portfolio of smartphones, the Phone 1 was very much a flagship in terms of the amount of care we put into the product. That’s why I used the word ‘premium’ [to describe the Phone 2] instead, which signifies that it’s a more premium step up, but it’s still a flagship just like the Phone 1."

Originally, Pei had chosen not to launch the Phone (2) anytime soon because he didn't want to launch a new device every year and so the Nothing team could focus on the Phone (1)'s software. However, the company has grown since then, doubling their team from 200 to 400 which has helped them make Nothing OS completely in-house rather than half-in and half-out. The Nothing team had just successfully launched Nothing OS 1.5 based on Android 13 this month, Jan. 13th, four days earlier than the expected Jan. 17th launch-date.

`UPDATE 1031 EST: Added information about the Moto Secure application that launched alongside the Moto G73 and Moto G53 and is also available on the ThinkPhone.`

Motorola are the king of budget friendly mobile handsets, especially here in the United States. While their specs aren't appealing to the tech savvy, their affordable price and flagship-like design sure attract plenty of price-concious buyers. Here's a bit of a dive into their newly released G73, G53, G23, G13 and E13 mobile handsets.

### Moto G73 and G53

The higher end brothers of the G series, this years GX3, devices feature a host of similar specs and follow similar designs to each other. They definitely shake up a few specs compared to last generations GX2 devices, replacing trade-offs with different features compared to last year, however they chose a lot of areas to trade-off. While the processors are newert his year, they are only small upgrades to their previous generations. However, they are more capable than the generation prior and bring sub-6GHz 5G to the higher end G-line.

The biggest downgrade with the G73 especially has to be the LCD downgrade from the P-OLED display of the G72. OLED displays have much better colour reproduction and are generally better displays, however it is understandable since LCD's are both cheaper and battery efficient. Besides the display, the G72 had a more versatile triple camera system which was exchanged for a higher quality main lens and a similar (if not the same) ultrawide lens. I think this will be welcome upgrade despite the loss of the depth sensor and the higher resolution main lens because Motorola tend to have weak camera systems, however many manufacturers have seen success with 50 MP sensors.

The G53 sees a much more significant display downgrade, going from a 6.6" FHD 90 Hz AMOLED panel to a slightly smaller 120 Hz LCD HD panel. I personally would prefer a 60 Hz standard refresh rate with a bump up in resolution than this configuration Motorola have conjured. I guess someone somewhere values speed and fluidity over quality in low-end devices? Besides that, the G53 reduces fast charging from Moto's 30W TurboCharge tech to just 10W on the international model and 18W on the Latin American model. Neither models have U.S. availability currently, so we'll see if we get faster charging or a device at all.

Both devices feature the same water repellant design, side mounted fingerprint sensors, face unlock, 5,000 mAh battery capacities, stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos, and hybrid micro SD card slots. They both also launch with Android 13 out of the box with MyUX onboard to tweak the system a little for the usual Motorola tricks. We are currently unsure if a charger will ship with these devices. 

### Moto G23 and G13

The lower end devices of the series have the same duo design and spec choice just like the higher-end siblings, which is for the worse in this particular line-up. 

| Specification | G23                                        | G13                                         |

Comparing to the last generation, the Moto G23 brings few improvements to the alredy "alright" device. It features a better, faster Helio G85 compared to the Helio G37 chipset, alongside faster wired charging. The new 8 GB RAM configuration helps with power and multi-tasking too, which this variation of the device was not available on the G22. However, the G23 does lose it's fourth sensor, the 8MP ultrawide lens seen on the G73. 

The Moto G13 isn't necessarily a direct successor to any particular model, as there was no G11 or G12 handset. However, it could be seen as a duo successor situation, truly going for quantity over quality just like their camera systems. A 'Lite' version of the older siblings, if you will. This pattern is similar to the higher end siblings too, with the G73 being the model and the G53 being the 'Lite'. I Can see why Motorola would want to try this approach with these hadnsets, however the execution could defintiely be better. It's a good thing this was being tested with the lower end G-series rather than the more mid-range, flagship-killer focused Edge devices.

### Moto E13

Last, but definitely not least, the Motorola Moto E13. This device is at the bottom of the bracket, being the most budget of the budget series. Lets see what Motorola decided to pack within this low-priced smartphone. 

| Specification | E13                                      |

| Refresh Rate  | 60 Hz                                    |

This handset really shows just how budget it is through the use of the Unisoc processor and the memory configuration, however this will definitely be fine considering the target market. This phone will be for anyone that just needs it to work, just something to get by with for calling and texting, maybe some basic web surfing. The processor really won't handle much else.

Alongside the launch of these five (5) handsets, Motorola has also announced the Moto Secure App for the ThinkPhone and Moto G53 and Moto G73. The Moto Secure app is basically your privacy and security dashboard on Pixel phones, however it does have a dash of Motorola too. On top of the privacy indicators and the 24-hour sensor log, you also gain the ability to create a "Secure Folder" on the device, allowing you to hide files and applications and you can enable a PIN Scramble feature for the devices lockscreen. There are a few more addiitons to the app too which help add peace of mind. Motorola has stated that the app will become available to more Android 13 based Moto phones in the coming months.

Whether we see these devices at all in the United States is anyone's guess, however they will be avilable in Europe, some of Asia, and Latin America starting in a few weeks.

Motorola are the king of budget friendly mobile handsets, especially here in the United States. While their specs aren't appealing to the tech savvy, their affordable price and flagship-like design sure attract plenty of price-conciious buyers. Here's a bit of a dive into their newly released G73, G53, G23, G13 and E13 mobile handsets.

### Moto G73 and G53

The higher end brothers of the G series, this years GX3, devices feature a host of similar specs and follow similar designs to each other. They definitely shake up a few specs compared to last generations GX2 devices, replacing trade-offs with different features compared to last year, but I think they made some good choices this year on exactly where they should compromise. For example, providing great processors this year will bring much needed performance improvements in every aspect of the device. It even brings 5G support to the entire G line-up.

The mid-range Galaxy A-series have been a really big hit in a lot of markets, especially in the United States.  A lot of have been affected by the pandemic and are switching to or buying new midrange devices over their usual flagship conunterparts as a cost-effective way to save money. I've had a lot of friends buy the Galaxy A53 5G, the current generation of the A50 series, a whole lot this year and is quite possibly the most popular A series phone in the current line-up. 

The A53 certainly deserved its popularity too as it was a beast of a phone. It packed an Exynos 1280 processor paired with up to 8 GB of RAM, had the lines best and most verstile camera system, and topped battery life usage with its 5,000 mAh battery. The next gen A54 certainly has a name to live up to, especially in the overcrowded midrange smartphone world. So let's dive in and find out what we already know about the upcoming A54 and what we don't already know. Hopefully this device will live up to the hype that the A53 has left behind. 

## What We Know So Far

#### Design

The design of the A54 is largely influenced by the Galaxy S23-series, which have already practically leaked in full. There are a few missing bits of information, but it's more of a fill in the blanks situation already. To be fair, we only have to wait about a week until the next Galaxy Unpacked launch event, which will be livestreamed from Samsung.com, Samsung's YouTube channel, and surely on other channels too. 

You can see a side-by-side design comparison below of the Galaxy S23 and the Galaxy A54.

Based on the image, you can just about tell that the sides of the A54 are plastic, which becomes more obvious when you see the premium side rails of the S23. They both seem very similar in design to the iPhone XR and some of the newer flat-edged Apple devices, only they both feature more than 1 or 2 lenses. Which, speaking of lenses, the S23's lenses seem a bit larger and protected by a more premium material again. Whereas the blue colour overlaps the top outline of the lens, the metal only reaches the top part of the S23 lens before black overtakes it.

Overall, I like the design, but it's nothing revolutionary. Pretty much the same sentiment as the S22 Ultra, where the design is nice and all but it's nothing special. Pretty boring honestly, and a very safe design from Samsung. The front panel is where it gets the most boring though, of course. The same central hole-punch camera and almost perfectly equal bezels besides the slightly larger chin. They have reduced the amount of chin added by pushing it to the sides and top of the device to almost equalize the bezel design. 

#### Processing Power

Last years A53 utilized the Exynos 1280 processor for performance on the device which many saw as a downgrade compared to the A52s' Snapdragon 778G chipset. While Samsung's chips aren't as bad as they used to be, they tend to be weaker performers in comparison to Qualcomm processors especially. However, the Exynos 1380 is rumoured to power the A54 which may be upgraded? There have been some leaks pointing towards the same Mali-G68-MP4 GPU for graphics processing, while others also point towards a G615 unit (SamMobile). It would be disappointing to see the Mali-G68 since that was also used in the Exynos 1280 for the A53. 

Besides graphics, SamMoile also spotted the processor going through certification via the Bluetooth SIG, confirming that the chipset will feature Bluetooth 5.3 for better wireless connectivity. It achieves this through a separate RF chip via Samsung Bluetooth Controller v6. They believe the chipset will feature two high-performing Cortex-A series cores at minimum for the new chip.

Lastly, the device will come in two storage and RAM configurations: 6GB or 8GB RAM paired with 128GB or 256GB of storage. The chipset will equip the device with WiFi 6 and sub-6GHz 5G capabilities, NFC, and the aformentioned Bluetooth 5.3. 

#### Display

The Galaxy A50 series have stuck to a 6.5 inch display pretty consistently for the past three or four generations, however the original A50 started off with a 6.4 inch display. While the A54 won't come with that "small" a display, it may not stay at 6.5" either. Some rumours are saying it'll stay the same, however some other sources also suggest Sammy upgrading to a 6.6" display. This could potentially be to save money on displays, since they would only have to make one size for both the Galaxy S23+ and Galaxy A54. Further evidence suggests there may not be a Galaxy A74 to top off the A series this year, which could've lead to the slight display size increase. 

Other than the size of the display, everything else about it will be the same FHD, 120 Hz, Super AMOLED panel. 

#### Battery & Charging

Like always, the charger will not ship with the device to get the juicy 25W fast charging speeds for your undoubtedly large 5,100 mAh battery. It is still such a shame that Samsung can't at least provide faster charging speeds for a device with such a large bettery, saving 45W top ups for the Galaxy S23+ and Galaxy S23 Ultra.

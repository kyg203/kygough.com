The mid-range Galaxy A-series have been a really big hit in a lot of markets, especially in the United States.  A lot of have been affected by the pandemic and are switching to or buying new midrange devices over their usual flagship conunterparts as a cost-effective way to save money. I've had a lot of friends buy the Galaxy A53 5G, the current generation of the A50 series, a whole lot this year and is quite possibly the most popular A series phone in the current line-up. 

The A53 certainly deserved its popularity too as it was a beast of a phone. It packed an Exynos 1280 processor paired with up to 8 GB of RAM, had the lines best and most verstile camera system, and topped battery life usage with its 5,000 mAh battery. The next gen A54 certainly has a name to live up to, especially in the overcrowded midrange smartphone world. So let's dive in and find out what we already know about the upcoming A54 and what we don't already know. Hopefully this device will live up to the hype that the A53 has left behind. 

### What We Know So Far

#### Design

The design of the A54 is largely influenced by the Galaxy S23-series, which have already practically leaked in full. There are a few missing bits of information, but it's more of a fill in the blanks situation already. To be fair, we only have to wait about a week until the next Galaxy Unpacked launch event, which will be livestreamed from Samsung.com, Samsung's YouTube channel, and surely on other channels too. 

You can see a side-by-side design comparison below of the Galaxy S23 and the Galaxy A54.

Based on the image, you can just about tell that the sides of the A54 are plastic, which becomes more obvious when you see the premium side rails of the S23. They both seem very similar in design to the iPhone XR and some of the newer flat-edged Apple devices, only they both feature more than 1 or 2 lenses. Which, speaking of lenses, the S23's lenses seem a bit larger and protected by a more premium material again. Whereas the blue colour overlaps the top outline of the lens, the metal only reaches the top part of the S23 lens before black overtakes it.

Overall, I like the design, but it's nothing revolutionary. Pretty much the same sentiment as the S22 Ultra, where the design is nice and all but it's nothing special. Pretty boring honestly, and a very safe design from Samsung. The front panel is where it gets the most boring though, of course. The same central hole-punch camera and almost perfectly equal bezels besides the slightly larger chin. They have reduced the amount of chin added by pushing it to the sides and top of the device to almost equalize the bezel design.

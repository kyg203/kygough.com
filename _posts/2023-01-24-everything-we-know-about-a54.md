The mid-range Galaxy A series have been a really big hit in a lot of markets, especially in the United States. I've had a lot of friends switch to the Galaxy A53 5G, the current generation of the A0 series, a whole lot this year and is quite possibly the most popular A series phone in the lineup. 

The A53 certainly deserved its popularity too as it was a beast of a phone. It packed an Exynos 1280 processor paired with up to 8 GB of RAM, had the lines best and most verstile camera array, and topped battery life usage with its 5,000 mAh battery. The next gen A54 certainly has a name ot live up to, especially in the overcrowded midrange smartphone world.

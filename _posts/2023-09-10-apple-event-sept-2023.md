title: Apple Event 2023 - What To Expect
---

The next Apple launch event is literally two days away, so all the leaks and rumours are in full swing in the same last-minute fashion. I think we all already know to expect the next generation iPhone's along with new software releases, however we may see some more iterative updates too with the possibility of a new AirPdos case. We've compiled all of the latest information about the upcoming gadgets and software to make it easier to learn more.

iPhone 15 and 15 Plus: Goodbye notch!

When the iPhone X was released back in September of 2018, it caused a lot of fuss due to the new industry trend, the notch display. While many resented the design because of the amount of screen real-estate it takes up, it quickly became a trend throughout the smartphone industry, with even Google including the infamous "bath-tub" notch on the Pixel 3 XL. Since then, Apple has decreased the size of the notch with each iteration which helped with the rise of the Dynamic Island, launched last year on the 14 Pro models. The island must have been a sucess because the design will also come to the regular 15 and 15 Plus models this year, most likely with better 3rd party software support that will be demoed at the launch event. We already have Uber support, so we'll see what other apps will bring Live Activities support to their app or service.

Another major change to the iPhone's this year is the charging port. Due to new regulation changes in the EU, Apple (bold) MUST include a USB-C charging port across their entire portfolio. They already have it on the iPad's and Macbooks, but now they must bring it to their smartphones and earbuds. While we have been awaiting a USB-C iPhone for a long time now, don't expect the same level of compatibility and versatility the port typically allows across devices. Apple will be implementing a 3LD3 for transmission encryption which could limit some features that are capable over a USB-C cable. For example, data transfer. While some leakers have speculated it could be used to limit fast charging to specific 'Made For iPhone' cables, others are saying the chip will only limit certain features such as data transfer and not necessarily fast charge capability. Since Apple won't directly tell us this on-stage, we most likely will have to wai tuntil the devices are in our hands to test the functionality of the chip, 1st party and 3rd party cables and adapters. At least this time around Apple will be providing colour-specific USB cables for each iPhone, the same thing they ddi with MagSafe cables on the M2 Macbook Air. Lastly, we COULD see a frosted back on the standard series for the first time, so stay tuned for that nice addition!

Besides these cosmetic changes, the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus will use the upgraded A16 chipset and 48 MP wide lens from the 14 Pro duo last year. The chipset of course will allow the device to be more powerful, while the larger megapixel count will lead to (hopefully) more detail and better lowlight photography. Since the same sensor was used last year, this should have given Apple additonal time to optimize it on the software front for better results compared to last year. We could see an upgraded Qualcomm 5G chip, but that could also be reserved for the A17 being utilized in this years 15 Pro duo.

Pricing for the standard pair are expected to stay the same with colours being updated to black, white, coral, yellow, and blue.


iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max: New improvements at a cost.

The Pro models this year are making the switch from a steel frame to a titanium frame, creating a lighter device with slimmer and curvier bezels. It will come with the same USB-C port only with faster data transfer speeds with USB 3.2 (20 Gbps) and possibly Thunderbolt 3 or 4 support. Along with the increased transfer speed the Pro models could flex 35W fast charge support, finally catching up with Google and Samsung but still far behind the competition outside the U.S. It's still a welcome addition, but seriously Apple, catch up.

The mute switch may switch to an Action button, similar to the Apple Watch Ultra's button. It will still hold the ability to mute the device, but it's rumoured to launch or start a plethora of activities and functions, likely customizable through Siri Shortcuts. 

Of course, there'll be "minor improvements" to the camera setup of the 15 Pro, however the biggest imprvoement will be seen on the 15 Pro Max due to the rumoured periscope telephoto lens, possibly bringing 5x or 6x zoom compared to the 15 Pro's 3x. The new A17 chip, designed on a more battery efficient yet more powerful 3nm node, will help power the phone alongside 8 GB of RAM, up from 6 GB last year. Whether or not more RAM will actually help with multitasking is yet to be seen, but is unlikely. The new chip will bring WiFi 6E to the Pro models and a new U2 ultrawideband chip, likely to be used for the Vision Pro headset. We could see 2 TB storage, but I would not expect this change.

The only downside to all of these changes is the price. It's likely that the price will jump to $1,099 starting for the 15 Pro and $1,199 for the 15 Pro Max. The biggest reason for the price hike is the chipset, more specifically the 3nm node it's built on which itself is a lot more costly than the 5nm node the A16 was built on. That along with the titanium build and periscope lens are the primary culprits.

We should see some new Apple cases for the new 15 series, however we will no longer see the leather cases that were sold with the 14 series. Instead, they'll be switching to a more environmentally friendly material, possibly "FineWoven" models. There will be new colours though, incuding a new mulberry silicone case.

Apple Watch Series 9 & Watch Ultra 2: New chips!

This generation of the main Apple Watch series will focus a lot more on internals than anything else. There'll be a new S9 chip for the Series 9 built around the same technology as the A15 chip used in the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus. This marks the first major chip upgrade in the watch series since the Series 6 watch in 2020. Besides that new chip, it will feature the same U2 ultrawideband chip found in the 15 Pro's which will help with better location tracking along with a new optical heartrate sensor. The new chips are said to perform better and last longer, so lets hope they deliver in these aspects. 

Besides that, there could be a new pink-ish alumuminium frame along with new watch band options, including some eco-friendly options too. No leaks on changing in pricing has surfaced, however the stainless steel watches could be experimenting with 3D printing to potentially reduce costs, so be on the look out for that announcement at the event. Nothing else has changed about the next generation Apple Watch, so a lot of people may skip this minor upgrade this generation.

The Apple Watch Ultra 2 sees the exact same improvments to the internals with very little else to differentiate it with last years Watch Ultra. I'm thinking they just want to make sure Ultra fans get the latest and greatest to match with the Series 9 rather than leaving them a little behind on the internals. I doubt they would increase the price of the already extortionate watch, but it could also be a bit lighter? Or, darker in colour at least with the new black housing.

Other Announcements

All the new AirPods Pro's will feature a USB-C case instead of a lightning port case. Everything else about them are exactly the same, they just switched the case out to follow EU regulations. It's not worth the upgrade if you already have a pair, but if you really want USB-C that bad then be Apple's guest.

We may see the annual release of the regular iPad, putting us at the 11th generation and seeing some pretty minor internal upgrades like the A15 chip replacing the A14. The new iPad is not for sure as it could skip this year and head for Spring 2024, we'll just have to wait and see.
